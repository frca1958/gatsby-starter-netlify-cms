# Here it is.

The first blog. With an image of course.

![Just trying](/img/5110b1.jpg "How to walk upon the water...")

Ok, now some code

```
if (isLoggedIn()) {    content.message = `Hello, ${user.user_metadata &&      user.user_metadata.full_name}`  } else {    content.message = 'You are not logged in'  }
```

is it colored?
